# Google Maps Module Documentation

* [Installation](installation.md)
* [Getting Started](getting_started.md)

## Notes

This module is a heavily re-written version of the [GoogleMapsBasic](https://github.com/sunnysideup/silverstripe-googlemapbasic)
module created by [Sunnysideup](https://github.com/sunnysideup).

This re-write makes use of the V3 engine for Google Maps API, allows for
multiple maps to be embeded on a page that can be acessed in the same
manner as any other object set.

Now you can add your account API Key in your SiteConfig. If you do not add
a key, maps will still work, but with a limited number of requests.

This re-write also makes use of the [gmap3](http://gmap3.net/) jquery plugin.
